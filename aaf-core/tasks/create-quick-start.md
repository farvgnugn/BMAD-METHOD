# create-quick-start

Create a getting started guide that gets users to their first success as quickly as possible.

## Purpose

Design and write a quick-start guide that minimizes time-to-value for new users by focusing on the shortest path to a meaningful outcome. This is often the most critical piece of documentation for user adoption.

## Prerequisites

- Completed product analysis with user journey mapping
- Understanding of the "aha moment" or first success scenario
- Knowledge of common setup requirements and potential blockers
- Access to test the quick-start process from scratch

## Quick-Start Design Principles

### Core Principles
```markdown
- [ ] Focus on ONE primary use case that demonstrates value
- [ ] Minimize prerequisites and setup complexity
- [ ] Provide working examples that users can copy/modify
- [ ] Include expected outcomes and success criteria
- [ ] Address the most common failure points proactively
```

### Success Criteria Definition
```markdown
- [ ] What specific outcome proves the product works?
- [ ] How will users know they've succeeded?
- [ ] What should they be able to do after completing this guide?
- [ ] What confidence should they have to continue using the product?
- [ ] How does this connect to their larger goals?
```

## Content Structure Framework

### Opening Hook (First 30 Seconds)
```markdown
- [ ] Clear statement of what they'll accomplish
- [ ] Time estimate for completion
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated
- [ ] Value proposition reinforcement
- [ ] Link to help/support if they get stuck
```

### Prerequisites Section
```markdown
- [ ] Minimum required setup (nothing extra)
- [ ] Version requirements and compatibility
- [ ] Account/access requirements
- [ ] Tool installations needed
- [ ] Knowledge assumptions stated clearly
```

### Step-by-Step Process
```markdown
Each step must include:
- [ ] Clear action to take
- [ ] Expected result/output
- [ ] Screenshot or code sample when helpful
- [ ] Common problems and quick fixes
- [ ] Progress indicator (step X of Y)
```

### Success Validation
```markdown
- [ ] How to verify each step worked
- [ ] What the final result should look like
- [ ] How to test that everything is working
- [ ] What to do if something doesn't match expectations
- [ ] Next steps or recommended actions
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Encouraging**: Assume success, provide confidence
- **Concise**: Every word serves the user's goal
- **Precise**: Use exact terminology and specific instructions
- **Helpful**: Anticipate confusion and address it proactively
- **Action-Oriented**: Lead with verbs, focus on what to do

### Language Patterns
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD Examples:
- "Click the blue 'Create Project' button in the top right"
- "You should see a green checkmark next to each item"
- "If the page doesn't load within 30 seconds, try refreshing"

‚ùå AVOID Examples:
- "Navigate to the project creation interface"
- "Ensure successful completion of the process"
- "Troubleshoot any issues that may arise"
```

### Visual Elements
```markdown
- [ ] Screenshots for complex UI interactions
- [ ] Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Callout boxes for important warnings
- [ ] Progress indicators or checklists
- [ ] Before/after comparisons when helpful
```

## Content Testing Process

### Self-Testing Protocol
```markdown
- [ ] Complete the quick-start from scratch on clean environment
- [ ] Time how long it actually takes
- [ ] Note every point of confusion or hesitation
- [ ] Verify all screenshots and examples are current
- [ ] Test all links and external dependencies
```

### User Testing Validation
```markdown
- [ ] Watch 3-5 new users attempt the quick-start
- [ ] Note where they get stuck or confused
- [ ] Record actual completion times
- [ ] Gather feedback on clarity and usefulness
- [ ] Iterate based on observed behavior
```

## Common Quick-Start Patterns

### For Developer Tools
```markdown
1. Installation/Setup (minimize this)
2. "Hello World" example that actually works
3. Customization of the basic example
4. Integration with existing workflow
5. Where to go for advanced features
```

### For Business Applications
```markdown
1. Account setup and basic configuration
2. Core workflow completion (end-to-end)
3. Results verification and interpretation
4. Common next steps or use cases
5. How to get help and learn more
```

### For APIs/Integrations
```markdown
1. Authentication and basic connection
2. Simple API call with real response
3. Data manipulation or processing example
4. Error handling demonstration
5. Links to comprehensive API documentation
```

## Quality Checklist

### Content Quality
```markdown
- [ ] Can be completed by target user in stated time
- [ ] Every step has been tested recently
- [ ] Screenshots are current and accurate
- [ ] Code examples actually work
- [ ] Links and references are functional
```

### User Experience
```markdown
- [ ] Clear value proposition stated upfront
- [ ] Success criteria are obvious
- [ ] Common failure points are addressed
- [ ] Help and support options are prominent
- [ ] Next steps are clearly defined
```

### Technical Accuracy
```markdown
- [ ] All technical details are correct
- [ ] Version dependencies are current
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] Performance implications are considered
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
```

## Output Template Structure

### Quick-Start Guide Format
```markdown
# Get Started with {Product Name}

*Complete your first {outcome} in {time estimate}*

## What You'll Build
{Brief description of the end result and why it matters}

## Before You Begin
- [ ] {Prerequisite 1}
- [ ] {Prerequisite 2}
- [ ] {Prerequisite 3}

*Estimated time: {X minutes}*

---

## Step 1: {Action}
{Clear instruction with expected outcome}

{Code sample or screenshot if needed}

‚úÖ **Success check**: {How to verify this step worked}

## Step 2: {Action}
{Clear instruction with expected outcome}

---

## üéâ You Did It!
{Celebration of what they accomplished}

### What You Built
{Summary of the outcome and its value}

### Next Steps
- [ ] {Logical next action 1}
- [ ] {Logical next action 2}
- [ ] {Link to advanced tutorials}

### Need Help?

```

## Integration Points

- Links to comprehensive tutorials for deeper learning
- References to API documentation for technical details
- Connection to troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Integration with onboarding flows and user activation
- Analytics tracking for completion rates and drop-off points

## Key Principles

- **Time-to-Value**: Get users to success as quickly as possible
- **Real-World Focus**: Use meaningful examples, not toy scenarios
- **Confidence Building**: Each step should increase user confidence
- **Failure Prevention**: Address common problems before they happen
- **Path Forward**: Clear next steps after quick-start completion
