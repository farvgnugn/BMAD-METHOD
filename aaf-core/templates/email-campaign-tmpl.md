## Email Writing Best Practices

### Subject Line Formulas

- "Quick question about {relevant topic}"
- "{Specific result} in {timeframe}? Here's how..."

❌ AVOID These Subjects:

### Email Structure Guidelines

✅ SCANNING-Friendly Format:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Subheadings to break up content
- Bold text for emphasis (sparingly)
- White space for easy reading
```

### Personalization Strategies
```markdown
- Use first name in subject and greeting
- Reference their signup source or interest
- Segment based on behavior or preferences
- Include location-specific information
- Reference their industry or role
- Mention their company size or type
```

## A/B Testing Elements

1. **Subject Lines**: Different angles or emotional appeals
2. **Send Times**: Day of week and time of day
3. **From Names**: Company vs. personal name

5. **CTA Buttons**: Text, color, placement
6. **Images**: With vs. without visuals

8. **Content Format**: Story vs. tips vs. case study
```

## Performance Metrics
