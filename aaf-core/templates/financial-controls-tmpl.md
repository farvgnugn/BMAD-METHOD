## Segregation of Duties Matrix

### Critical Control Functions
```markdown
## Segregation of Duties: [Process Name]

| Function | Authorization | Recording | Custody | Reconciliation |
|----------|--------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Cash Receipts | [Role] | [Role] | [Role] | [Role] |
| Cash Disbursements | [Role] | [Role] | [Role] | [Role] |

| Journal Entries | [Role] | [Role] | N/A | [Role] |
| Bank Reconciliations | N/A | N/A | N/A | [Role] |

### Key Principles:
- ✅ No single individual should control all aspects of any transaction
