## Writing Guidelines for Quick-Starts

### Opening Section Best Practices
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD Examples:
- "Build your first chatbot in 10 minutes"
- "Deploy a secure API to production in 15 minutes"
- "Create a dashboard that visualizes your data in 5 minutes"

‚ùå AVOID Examples:
- "Learn about our platform capabilities"
- "Understand the system architecture"
- "Explore various configuration options"
```

### Step Writing Patterns
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD Step Titles:
- "Connect to your database"
- "Create your first workflow"
- "Test the integration"

‚ùå AVOID Step Titles:
- "Database connectivity"
- "Workflow management"
- "Integration testing"
```

### Success Check Examples
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD Success Checks:
- "You should see a green 'Connected' status in the dashboard"
- "The API should return a 200 status with your user data"
- "Your terminal should display 'Build successful' in green text"

‚ùå AVOID Success Checks:
- "Ensure the connection is established"
- "Verify successful completion"
- "Check that everything is working"
```
