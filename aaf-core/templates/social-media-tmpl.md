#### Educational/Value Post
```markdown
{Hook Question or Bold Statement}

{Personal story or experience that relates}

Here's what I learned:

{Practical application or actionable advice}

What's been your experience with {topic}?

```

**Example:**
```markdown
"This is why your marketing campaigns aren't working."

Last month, I analyzed 50 failed campaigns from B2B companies.

The pattern was clear:

‚Üí They focused on features, not outcomes
‚Üí They talked at customers, not with them
‚Üí They measured vanity metrics, not revenue

The fix? Start every campaign by asking: "What does success look like for my customer?"

Then work backwards.

What's the biggest marketing mistake you see companies make?
